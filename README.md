## Part 2 Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
### Open in Jupyter Notebook 
### Visit and inspect Mars Temperature data site
### Create Beautiful Soup object to scrape data in HTML table using Pandas read_html
### Assemble data in Pandas Dataframe 
### Examine column data types and convert where necessary 
### Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:
###   How many months exist on Mars?
###   How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
###   What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
###     Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
###     Plot the results as a bar chart.
###   Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
###     Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
###     Plot the results as a bar chart.
###   About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
###     Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
###     Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.

### Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
